The UASAL team is an active contributor to the Physical Optics Propagation in Python library, [POPPY](https://github.com/spacetelescope/poppy). A BSD licensed open source project, POPPY provides user-friendly, high-performance set of diffraction simulation tools in both the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regimes, broadly applicably but particularly well suited to astronomical telescopes and high-contrast imaging. 

We have also begun contributing to the [CubeSat Climate CoBuild](https://c3.pubpub.org/) open source outreach hardware project. 

Members of the lab are active in the University of Arizona [Astronomy Camp](https://www.astronomycamp.org) and the                                                                                       [Tucson Initiative for Minority Engagement in Science and TEchnology Program (TIMESTEP)](https://lavinia.as.arizona.edu/~timestep/).
