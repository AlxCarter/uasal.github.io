Our research interest spans development of new instruments and missions for space science to radiative transfer modeling of extrasolar star systems. For our past work, see our public library from the NASA ADS: [UASAL Publications Library](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/r6ora761TSasD0yJkA3y-g) and [team member]({{ '/Team' | relative_url}}) individual publications.

Contact [Ewan Douglas](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/ewan-douglas) if you are interested in joining our team or collaborating.

Our research is primarily funded by NASA.



To directly support our work lowering the cost of astronomy from space and developing new technologies to image extrasolar planets, you can give to the [UA Foundation](https://give.uafoundation.org/science-astronomy) and put UASAL CubeSats, UASAL Space Coronagraph Project, or Douglas Lab in the Other field. For more information, contact Cathi Duncan (cduncanf@email.arizona.edu) or Ewan Douglas.
